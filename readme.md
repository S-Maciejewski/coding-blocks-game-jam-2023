# Game
## Reverse battleships
The game is wirtten in Go with ebiten and deployed here: https://s-maciejewski.github.io/coding-blocks-game-jam-2023

### Description
Since the theme is _Everything is backwards_ we've decided to make a classic battleships with a twist - you're playing as ships evading bombs

# Setup
This is a guide to setting up a development environment for the project.

## Installing go 1.19.5 on Windows

### Using installer from Go website
1. Download the installer from https://golang.org/dl/go1.19.5.windows-amd64.msi

### Using Scoop
1. Install Scoop: https://scoop.sh/
2. Add main bucket: `scoop bucket add main`
3. Install go: `scoop install go`

Using scoop makes it easier to update and manage in the future.

### Editor
I recommend using GoLand by Jetbrains but VSCode with the Go extension will work fine.
